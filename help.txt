## LVL
The "level of creativity" is actually the temperature argument for GPT-3, where
creativity of 5 means the temperature of 1. If you set the creativity value to 0
you will get no randomness. GPT-3 will always produce the same output for a given
quesiton. On the other hand, setting the creativity value to 5 will deliver very
inconsistent and sometimes interesting results. Even for open-ended tasks you
should use a temperature value of 5 only in special situations. It is more common
for story completion or idea generation to see temperature values between 4 and 5.
The default value is 2 (temperature: 0.4).

## SUBMISSION
Hitting ENTER after two empty lines in a NOCODE mode is a handy cross-platform equivalent
for [Ctrl+Z]+[ENTER] in Windows, or [Ctrl+D] in Linux/Mac terminals. It basically
terminates standard input by outputting EOF (end of file).

The application also accepts multiline inputs until the sentence ends with a
questiton mark.
