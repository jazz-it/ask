2. LVL
───────────────────
A lower temperature will stick to the facts and will lead to more predictable results,
while a higher temperature will lead to more creative, but less accurate results.
Default value: 2, allowed input: any value [0-5]

3. SUBMISSION
───────────────────
Hitting ENTER after two empty lines in a NOCODE mode is a handy cross-platform equivalent
for [Ctrl+Z]+[ENTER] in Windows, or [Ctrl+D] in Linux/Mac shells. It basically terminates
standard input by outputting EOF (end of file).

The application also accepts multiline inputs until the sentence ends with a questiton mark.
