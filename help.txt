CODE   - disables two empty lines to trigger submission
NOCODE - enables two empty lines to trigger submission (default)
EXIT   - same as any other input less than 7 characters long ends the application

Hitting ENTER after two empty lines in a NOCODE mode is a handy cross-platform equivalent 
for [Ctrl+Z]+[ENTER] in Windows, or [Ctrl+D] in Linux/Mac terminals. It basically 
terminates standard input by outputting EOF (end of file).

The application accepts multiline inputs until the sentence ends with a questiton mark.
Editting multiline inputs is available by using cursor keys on your keyboard.
